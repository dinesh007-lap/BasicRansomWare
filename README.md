# üîê Noob Ransomware Simulation (Educational Only)
***USE IN A VERY SAFE AND ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS VIRTUALBOX,VMWARE ANY LOSS THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE***
This is a **simple ransomware simulation** built in Python using the `cryptography` library (Fernet).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do not use it for malicious activities. I take no responsibility for any misuse.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Noob.py` ‚Üí Encryption script  
- `NoobDecrypt.py` ‚Üí Decryption script  
- `thekey.key` ‚Üí Encryption key (generated automatically)  

---

## üöÄ How It Works
1. The encryption script (`Noob.py`):
   - Generates a Fernet key (`thekey.key`)
   - Encrypts all files in the directory (except the scripts and key file)

2. The decryption script (`NoobDecrypt.py`):
   - Reads `thekey.key`
   - Decrypts all files in the directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- `cryptography` library  

Install the library:  
```bash
pip install cryptography
